#  MavenFlix Video Streaming Subscription Analysis

This repository contains my SQL-based analysis of MavenFlixâ€™s subscription data, covering subscription trends, customer loyalty, and retention performance.

##  Project Overview

**Objective:**  
Analyze MavenFlixâ€™s subscription data to uncover:
- How subscriptions have trended over time.
- What percentage of customers stay subscribed for five months or more.
- Which months show the highest and lowest retention rates.

The insights help MavenFlix make data-driven decisions to increase customer loyalty, reduce churn, and strengthen subscription growth.


##  Data Cleaning

Before analysis, the dataset was checked and cleaned:
- Assessed and handled **null values** in key fields (`canceled_date`, `subscription_cost`, `subscription_interval`, `was_subscription_paid`).
- Created a **subscription_status** column to classify active vs. canceled subscriptions.



## Key Findings

- **New subscriptions:** Identified trends in monthly new sign-ups.
- **Cancellations:** Highlighted periods with high cancellations.
- **Retention:** Pinpointed the best and worst months for keeping subscribers.
- **Loyalty:** Found the percentage of customers staying 5+ months.


##  Recommendations

- Implement loyalty rewards for long-term subscribers.
- Investigate causes of churn during low-retention months.
- Launch targeted campaigns to improve retention.
- Monitor KPIs regularly to inform marketing and content strategies.


##  Tools Used

- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Language:** SQL  
- **Presentation:** PowerPoint
